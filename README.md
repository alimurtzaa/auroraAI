## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Text-to-Design**: Enter a simple description and instantly generate Figma-compatible designs.
- **Editable Designs**: Preview AI-generated designs and iterate with new prompts.
- **Export Options**: Download `.fig` files or push directly to Figma via API.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Create and refine UI prototypes faster than ever.
- **Future-Ready**: Designed for iterative editing, design system integration, and multi-modal input (coming in later phases).

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React / Next.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Layer**: OpenAI GPT-4 or equivalent
- **Preview**: `react-figma` or custom canvas renderer
- **Storage**: Redis / MongoDB (temporary design storage)
- **Figma Integration**: Figma REST API


## ðŸ”® Roadmap

* **Phase 1**: Text-to-Figma MVP (current)
* **Phase 2**: Iterative re-prompting & editing
* **Phase 3**: Multi-modal input (sketch, image references)
* **Phase 4**: Design system & component library integration
* **Phase 5**: Real-time collaboration & AI suggestions
